# Description
Add new parameters or modify exisiting ones from .CSV file to Vector Canape .a2l file 

# Why you might need this script?
If you use Vector Canape to add or modify a huge number of parameters (order of thousands) you might need a CSV file to add or modify all the new values. Using the user interface is time consuming, so you could use this tool to import values directly from an CSV file to the .a2l file.
